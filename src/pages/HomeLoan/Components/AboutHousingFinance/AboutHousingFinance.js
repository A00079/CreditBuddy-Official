                        <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed fnt-sty-nunito">A house loan, also known as a home loan, is a quantity of money borrowed from a financial institution or bank to acquire a home. Home loans have an adjustable or fixed interest rate as well as payment terms. </p>
                        <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed fnt-sty-nunito">People typically take out a home loan to either purchase a house/flat or a plot of land for the construction of a house, or to renovate, extend, and repair an existing property </p>
                        <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed fnt-sty-nunito">The property is mortgaged to the lender as security until the loan is repaid. The bank or financial organisation will keep the title or deed to the property until the loan is repaid in full, including interest. </p>
                        <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed fnt-sty-nunito">Home loan interest rates can be fixed or floating, or partly fixed and partly floating, depending on the borrower's demands.
                            Certain tax incentives are also available on your home loan under Section 80EE of the Income Tax Act. However, only first-time home buyers are eligible for the income tax deduction on house loan interest.
