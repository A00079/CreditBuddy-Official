                            <p className="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4 fnt-sty-nunito">An individual’s age determines a suitable tenor for the home loan.

                            <p className="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4 fnt-sty-nunito">Based on the applicant’s profile, financial institutions also check their income stability.
