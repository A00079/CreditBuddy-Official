                        </h1>
                        <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed fnt-sty-nunito">A credit card is a small rectangular piece of plastic or metal provided by a bank or financial services business that allows cardholders to borrow funds to pay for products and services from retailers who accept credit cards. Credit cards require cardholders to repay the borrowed funds, plus any related interest, as well as any extra agreed charges, in full by the billing date or over time. Credit cards function as a micro loan tool, allowing individuals to make purchases with the condition of repaying them within a certain time period. If the required amount is paid within a certain time frame, no interest is paid (interest-free period). </p>

                        <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed fnt-sty-nunito">A credit card is a tool that allows you to perform fast credit-based transactions.</p>
                        <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed fnt-sty-nunito">Unlike debit cards, which are linked to your bank accounts and debit the corresponding amount for each transaction, credit cards allow you to make purchases on credit regardless of your account balance. These payments, however, are repayable at the conclusion of a pre-specified credit period, and each credit card has a credit limit that cannot be exceeded.</p>
